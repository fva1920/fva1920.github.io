    <h2 id="lets-see-if-we-can-still-do-it">Let’s see if we can still do it</h2>

<p>After a long time, a more complicated piece of fibre-reinforced plastic 
construction was once again produced in the FVA workshop.</p>

<p>Some time ago, it was envisaged within the FVA 30 to start manufacturing the 
first elements of our aircraft in winter 2021/22. For many reasons, it was agreed 
to start with the wings. As a result, the question arose as to whether we could do 
this so easily at all, or whether the skills within the FVA regarding the production 
of a flying part in GRP/CFRP construction did not need to be refreshed a little. It 
quickly became clear that the latter would make sense. Fortunately, an old mould
for a wing tip could still be fished out of the almost unfathomable depths of our 
storage containers. It was no longer flawless, but at least it had been taut in itself
for the undefined period of its storage, so that it could not warp. This made it 
more than suitable for our purposes and, after a few minor touch-ups, it shone 
almost like new again. And so Johannes “Nupsi” Geerling and Niklas Krampe drew
up a plan of how to go about making such a wing tip.</p>

<p>Based on this shape, Niklas and Nupsi managed to find out the necessary 
dimensions and geometries for the built-in parts such as spar and ribs and to 
build the corresponding moulds for them as well. Fortunately, a wing consists of 
more than just the shell visible from the outside; inside, a continuous spar and 
reinforcing ribs give it the necessary stiffness to withstand and conduct forces 
and moments from different directions.</p>

<p>After these preparations, the production team, consisting of Niklas, Nupsi, Eva 
“Theki” Schnierle, Felix “Alf” Diekmann, Linus Baur and Florian “Flock” Mock, 
could hardly wait to get started. They were actively supported by Paul “Küken” 
Ignatiadis and Marvin “Fläsh” Baun. The anticipation was palpable when it finally 
started on a Monday in mid-July. On day one and two, we started with smaller 
and lighter components. On these days, two C-shaped bridges were laminated, 
which were later glued together to form a double T-shaped bridge. The web is the
part of the spar that gives it almost its entire height. The spar is then completed 
by two straps that are glued to the top and bottom of the spar. The straps are 
usually quite flat, but should not be neglected when calculating the total height.</p>

<p>The main parts were then done in the following days. Now the shells of the wing 
were made. To do this, the shape of the wing end piece was laid out with suitably
cut-glass fibre fabric, which was then soaked in resin. This is the classic form of 
laminating by hand, the web and later the ribs were also made this way. Only for 
the straps did we resort to a different technique. The belts consist of extremely 
strong carbon fibres, which are laid as thin strands next to and on top of each 
other in a mould. These strands are called rovings and consist of many thousands
of individual fibres. Since they are pulled through a resin bath before being 
placed in the mould, where they soak up the resin, the corresponding machine is 
called a roving pulling machine. Adjustable rollers also ensure that the rovings 
only take up a defined amount of resin by scraping off the excess resin. The wing 
shells, however, are not only made of GRP, between two layers of glass fibre a 
hard foam is inserted for thickening, which we also had to cut to size. This 
laminate-foam-laminate construction is also called sandwich construction for 
obvious reasons.</p>

<p>At this point, we should not conceal the fact that we underestimated the amount 
of work involved in the production and that there were some mistakes that had to
be corrected later. But since the whole thing was meant to be a practical learning
experience, this was by no means a bad thing; in fact, it probably helped us to 
pay more attention to some things in the future. So finally, a little behind 
schedule, we got around to closing the mould of upper and lower shell around the
spar that had already been glued into a mould and adding two small ribs in front 
of and behind the spar to the open end. Now the gluing only had to harden and a 
few days later the big moment had come, we opened the mould again and out 
came a beautiful and with 4kg quite light wing tip that we are all proud of. The 
days in the workshop fulfilled their purpose, we were able to learn a lot and now 
have some people in the club who can claim to have resembled a wing structure.</p>

<p>Finally, of course, we wanted to know what our wing could withstand. We 
clamped it at one end, loaded a pallet with stones, attached the pallet to the 
wing and lifted the wing with the ant. Since the wing didn’t mind much in round 
one, more and more stones were added to the pallet. Up to a weight of 400kg the
wing lifted the pallets, only at 450kg it finally broke off at the clamping.
Building this wing end piece was a great pleasure for all of us and with the 
knowledge we gained we are now ready to start making wings for the FVA 30</p>
