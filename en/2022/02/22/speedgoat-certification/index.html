    <h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>The scientific aviation association (FVA) is developing the FVA 30, a hybrid electric motor glider,
in order to research alternative propulsion systems.
Due to strict safety requirements in aviation, the
electric drivetrain must be reliable at all time and
the responsible local aviation agency with jurisdiction requires evidence of compliance with the complex certification guidelines, which is a challenging
and time-consuming task for aerospace manufacturers. This article focuses on the certification process of the FVA 30 power train, using a Speedgoat
target computer.</p>

<h2 id="fva-30">FVA 30</h2>
<p>The aircraft features two electric motors at the tail
(Fig. 2). A high voltage lithium-ion battery pack
directly behind the canopy provides enough energy
for short flights powered exclusively by electricity. The fuselage contains two inverters to supply
the engines with AC voltage. As a hybrid electric
aircraft an additional generator and inverter connected to a propulsion engine charges the battery
during the flight. This combination of a highly efficient electric powertrain with fuel as an additional
energy source enables long flights with a range of
up to 650km. (Fig. 1) [8]</p>

<h2 id="certification-guidelines">Certification Guidelines</h2>
<p>According to European Union regulation nr.
2018/1139 [5], which provides basic laws for aviation safety, the FVA 30 project does fall under the
authority of the European Aviation Safety Agency
as it is considered a research aircraft. The competent authority according to §2 of the LuftGerPV
(the German federal ordinance on the testing of aircraft and aeronautical products) is the Luftfahrtbundesamt (LBA). [1] The LBA is part of the Federal Ministry of Transport and Digital Infrastructure and manages certification, approval and supervisory tasks in German aviation. [7] Since the FVA
30 will only be built once, the certification process
will be loosely based on annex 1 of EU regulation
nr. 748/2012 also referred to as ’Part 21’. This is
stated in §3 LuftGerPV. [1] The core of the process consists of a certification program defined in
close cooperation with the LBA. Firstly the LBA
determines the applicable EASA certification specifications (CS): in this case, CS-22 (Sailplanes and
Powered Sailplanes) was allocated. [6] Since current CSs do not cover electric aircraft, the preliminary Special Condition ’CS-22 Installation of electric propulsion units in powered sailplanes’ must
also be met. [3]Another unusual attribute of the
FVA 30 is its multi engine setup, which is uncommon in the class of (powered) sailplanes. Another
special condition is therefore being established in
cooperation with the LBA, which will include the
paragraphs of CS-23 (Normal-Category Airplanes)
applicable to multi engine aircraft. [4]</p>

<h2 id="means-of-compliance">Means of Compliance</h2>
<p>Compliance must demonstrated with each single
paragraph of the mentioned documents. This will
be carried out based on an extensive list entitled
Means of Compliance (MoC) and in accordance
with the details set out in Table 1 below. With regard to the FVA 30 drivetrain, we will concentrate
our efforts on design reviews, as well as laboratory
and ground tests. The Speedgoat target machine
can be used in conjunction with compliance methods number four ’Laboratory tests’ and number five
’Ground tests on related product’. The test programs will be performed and compliance-relevant
data recorded. Before the verification phase commences, the means of compliance will be agreed
with the LBA.</p>

<h2 id="laboratory-tests">Laboratory Tests</h2>
<p>In the first phase of the certification process, individual modules will be investigated for their use in
aviation. For this purpose, an ironbird has been
built, which is a setup of all the electronic components which will be installed in the future aircraft. The Speedgoat target machine can expose
the system to faults, critical environmental conditions and flight cases years ahead of the flight testing phase, effectively shortening development time.
These tests will be done according to existing specifications to guarantee an accurate recreation of the
use cases and maximum safety. These specifications
include RCTA DO-311, DO-160 and DO-178. Adhering to third party specifications for these tests
not only saves time, but also ensures that the same
level of safety can be reproduced for other aircraft.
The results and logs of, for example, a fault insertion are then transferred into individual certification reports.</p>

<h2 id="ground-and-flight-tests">Ground and Flight Tests</h2>
<p>Although all components are already tested before
the construction phase, additional items must also
be investigated in ground tests with the final assembled aircraft: for example, electromagnetic interferences can differ significantly from the effects
observed on the ironbird test bench. Another important part of the ground test is to verify the calculated and simulated characteristics for accuracy.
These tests are also conducted and documented by
the Speedgoat real time target machine. Various
measured values, for example cooling liquid temperatures are recorded over time and are appended
to the certification documents.
Each report will therefore demonstrate compliance with our MoC and will finally be provided to
the LBA for examination. After a successful inspection, only the flight-testing requirements will
be considered. Subsequently, the Speedgoat real
time target machine will serve as the ECM and
documentation tool to demonstrate further compliance.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>As described in (2), electrifying the power train
means that supplementary certification specifications must be met in addition to the usual certification specifications for powered sailplanes. Consequently, additional test bench runs are required.
Using a real-time target computer from Speedgoat,
the FVA can meet the additional specifications by
implementing an ironbird for the FVA 30. The
functionality of the electric system will be demonstrated in two stages: both in laboratory tests and
on the assembled aircraft. Another part of the certification is the documentation for test reports. For
this purpose, the FVA will use the Speedgoat target
machine, which will also record measurements.</p>
