    <p>The world’s largest general aviation trade show? Finally open again after a three-year break due to Corona? More than 600 exhibitors and over 30,000 visitors? That much is clear, the FVA can’t be missing!</p>

<p>Therefore, in the night from April 25 to 26, the first car set off from Aachen to Friedrichshafen to set up the exhibition area of the “Interessengemeinschaft Deutscher Akademischer Fliegergruppen” (Idaflieg) together with other academic flying groups for the four days of the fair from April 27 to 30. In addition to the FVA, the “Akademischen Fliegergruppen” (Akafliegs) from all over Germany used the opportunity to present their current projects to a large audience and to establish or maintain important contacts in the industry. Especially many members of our association wanted to follow this task, so that in the meantime 15 FVA members were on the way at the Aero. The days started with a common breakfast and the daily briefing, before it was divided into shifts to the stand support. This also left enough time for everyone to explore the extensive trade show in small groups or on their own during the breaks. After the end of the exhibition time we could talk to the members of the other Akafliegs about our projects or just get to know each other better over a cool drink. And also a common evening at the beach of Lake Constance could not be missed.</p>

<p>We were able to present two of our current research projects to the interested audience. On the one hand the FVA 24d or winding mimic, affectionately called Wimi by us. At our booth there was the only flying example of this latest generation of our rope pulling device to marvel at and one could learn what advantages the Wimi has over other rope pulling devices available on the market. On the other hand, we presented the FVA 30, our hybrid-electric motor glider, as an overall project and had a part of our test rig for the electric drive train as a demonstration object. In an artfully illuminated box stood a test module of the battery, which could be controlled from the outside. With the help of a control unit from the Swiss company Speedgoat, we also had the opportunity to simulate various fault situations in which the battery is disconnected from the power circuit. The crackling of opening contactors was clearly audible.</p>

<p>One of the main topics at Aero this year was sustainable aviation. A separate hall was dedicated to sustainability in general aviation, where mainly electrically or hybrid-electrically powered aircraft were on display. In addition to the overall concepts, detailed solutions and partial concepts were also shown, which can contribute to more sustainability and environmental protection in small aircraft construction. Our research in this direction at FVA 30 was also appreciated.</p>

<p>In conclusion, it can be said that Aero was a complete success for us. For many it was a new and exciting experience to represent the FVA at such a large exhibition, and the contacts made in general aviation will certainly bring great benefits to the projects and the association. A big thank you goes out to the organizing team, both the Idaflieg board for making the joint appearance at Aero possible, and Paul “Küken” Ignatiadis for organizing within the FVA. Aero was a great time for all and we look forward to representing the FVA at the next show!</p>
